#### Determine whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P TSX 60) and the whales portfolios.

- Algo 1 outperforms both the market (S&P TSX 60) and the whales' portfolios.  

- The market (S&P TSX 60) Annualized Sharpe Ratio is 0.19, and the whales' portfolios Annualized Sharpe Ratio is as: Soros Fund Management Llc: 0.286709; Paulson & Co.Inc: -0.547594; Tiger Global Management Llc: -0.144455; Berkshire Hathaway Inc: 0.467045)

- Algo 1 Annualized Sharpe Ratios is 1.49, more significant than 1.0. It not only outperforms other portfolios, but Algo 1 is also deemed acceptable to good for investors in terms of a high degree of expected return for a relatively low amount of risk.

- Algo 2 Annualized Sharpe Ratios is 0.39, and it outperforms the market (S&P TSX 60)  (Sharpe Ratio 0.19) and three stocks in whales' portfolios (Sharpe Ratio: Soros Fund Management Llc:  0.286709; Paulson & Co.Inc: -0.547594; Tiger Global Management Llc:  -0.144455). However, because Algo 2 Annualized Sharpe Ratios is below 1.0 is considered sub-optimal for investors.

#### How does your portfolio do?

- My portfolio (AMZN, AXP, Delta) Sharpe Ratio is 0.49, outperforming the market (S&P TSX 60), the whales' portfolios and Algo 2.

- The market (S&P TSX 60) Annualized Sharpe Ratio is 0.19; the whales' portfolios Annualized Sharpe Ratio is as: Soros Fund Management Llc: 0.286709; Paulson & Co.Inc: -0.547594; Tiger Global Management Llc: -0.144455; Berkshire Hathaway Inc: 0.467045); Algo 2 Annualized Sharpe Ratios is 0.39. My portfolio's Annualized Sharpe Ratios is higher than all of them, except Algo 1 (Annualized Sharpe Ratio: 1.49).

- In terms of a high degree of expected return for a relatively low amount of risk, my portfolio Annualized Sharpe Ratio is below 1.0 is considered sub-optimal for investors, and Algo 1 still is the best investment among all of these portfolios.
